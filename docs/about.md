With a desire to exercise creativity while combining my technical background in computer science, I am hoping to become a User Interface Developer. In my free time, I love engaging with the arts through drawing, painting, and design. I am excited to develop and apply these skills within the computer science field that I am currently in. 

On campus I am involved in the Women's Ultimate Frisbee team (lovingly known as Cypress) and the Society of Women in Computing (SWC). Ultimate has provided me with such a supportive community and has taught me the importance of teamwork in tandom with individual grit. In SWC, I work as the Public Relations Chair. One of my goals this year is to increase our retention through a more enhanced social media presence. Additionally, I spend a lot of time working at the campus library as a Circulation Desk Associate and Building Associate. In this position, I have developed great interpersonal skills, specifically when assisting patrons. 

When I am not doing school work, I enjoy preparing for the future, spending time outside, and staying active. Reading and working on side-projects are both reqarding and help to sharpen my skills. On weekends or extended time off, I love to go camping or take long hikes. One day I hope to thru hike the entire Appalachian Trail - I would walk through 14 states! I also like to take runs, play catch, practice yoga, and do (some) weightlifting. Staying active provides a nice break from work and school when things get tough :)
